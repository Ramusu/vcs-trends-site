<h1>History and Modern Trends in Version Control
Systems</h1>
<p1>
Version control systems (VCS) are essential tools that help track changes in files (usually source code)
over time. They allow multiple people to collaborate on projects, keep a history of modifications, and
revert to earlier versions when needed. This reading guide will walk you through the history of version
control – from its early centralized beginnings to today’s distributed systems – and highlight modern
trends shaping how we use version control.
