<h1>The Historical Timeline of Version Control Systems</h1>
<p>The evolution of VCS spans several decades, with distinct generations of tools marking key milestones.
Early systems were centralized, relying on a single repository server, while later systems introduced
distributed collaboration
</p>
<ul>
<l>1972: Source Code Control System (SCCS) – one of the first version control systems, developed
at Bell Labs, which introduced the basic idea of tracking changes (initially used on IBM
mainframes).</l>
<l>
1982: Revision Control System (RCS) – released by Walter Tichy at Purdue University, RCS
automated change tracking for individual files using delta storage (storing differences between
file versions) . RCS was a local VCS (no network support), handling one file at a time.
</l>
<l>
1986: Concurrent Versions System (CVS) – developed by Dick Grune as a front-end to RCS, CVS
allowed collaboration on whole projects with a client-server model . It added networked
repositories and concurrent multi-developer capabilities to RCS. CVS became widely used in the
1990s for open-source and commercial projects, despite limitations (e.g. non-atomic commits
and tricky branching).
</l>
<l>
2000: Subversion (SVN) – created by CollabNet as a successor to CVS, Subversion improved on
CVS’s weaknesses. SVN introduced atomic commits (all-or-nothing changesets), better handling
of file renames, and more efficient network operations. By ~2006, SVN had become one of the
most popular VCS tools, addressing many of CVS’s shortcomings . SVN was still
centralized: a single repository stored the code, and developers committed to that central server.
</l>
<l>
2005: Git and Mercurial – a breakthrough year for version control. In 2005, after the Linux
kernel’s commercial VCS (BitKeeper) license was revoked, Linus Torvalds created Git as a new
distributed VCS for the kernel . Around the same time, Matt Mackall released Mercurial. Both
Git and Mercurial are distributed version control systems (DVCS), meaning every user has a
full copy of the repository. Git quickly became the dominant VCS of the two – by 2019 it was
estimated to have ~80% market share vs. ~2% for Mercurial . (We’ll discuss distributed vs.
centralized concepts more in a moment.)
</l>
<l>
2008: GitHub launched – GitHub provided a web-based collaboration platform on top of Git. It
made sharing code and participating in projects easier with features like pull requests, issue
tracking, and social networking for developers. GitHub (and later similar services like Bitbucket
and GitLab) greatly accelerated Git’s adoption across the industry.

<l>
Late 2010s: GitOps and modern practices – In 2017, the term GitOps was introduced by
Weaveworks, highlighting an approach to use Git repositories as the single source of truth for
infrastructure and deployments (more on this later) . Integration of VCS with Continuous
Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines became mainstream, and cloud-hosted VCS
platforms grew in popularity.
</l>
<l>
2020s: AI and large-scale collaboration – Recent years have seen cloud platforms for VCS reach
massive scale (e.g. as of 2023 GitHub reported over 100 million developers using its platform
). Artificial intelligence is also beginning to assist in code management and review (with tools
like GitHub Copilot and AI-driven code review assistants). Version control remains central to
modern DevOps workflows, enabling everything from open-source projects with thousands of
contributors to automated infrastructure management via GitOps.
</l>
</ul>
<h1>Centralized vs. Distributed Version Control</h1>
<p>
Traditional centralized systems (CVS, SVN) rely on a single central server that stores the “official” version of code. Developers must be connected to commit or update, and if the server goes offline, development halts. Collaboration is linear—branches exist, but they’re cumbersome to create, manage, and merge.

</p>
<p>
Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)—such as Git and Mercurial—revolutionized this model:

</p>
<ul>
    <l>Complete Local Repositories: Every developer has a full copy of the entire project history. This eliminates single points of failure and allows full offline work.</l>
    <l>Local Commits: Developers can commit changes, revert, and inspect history locally without any network access.</l>
    <l>Fast Branching and Merging: DVCS made branching and merging lightweight operations. Developers can freely create feature branches, experiment, and merge later.</l>
    <l>Parallel and Nonlinear Development: Teams can work in parallel across branches and later merge contributions seamlessly. This encourages experimentation and reduces integration pain.</l>
    <l>Resilience and Flexibility: Because every clone is a full backup, data loss is nearly impossible. Teams can also organize around different collaboration models (central hub or peer-to-peer sharing).</l>
</ul>
<p>
This shift to distributed workflows made global collaboration (e.g., the Linux kernel’s thousands of contributors) feasible. It also paved the way for modern DevOps pipelines, where code, infrastructure, and automation all revolve around Git repositories.
