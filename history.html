<h>The Historical Timeline of Version Control Systems</h>
<p>The evolution of VCS spans several decades, with distinct generations of tools marking key milestones.
Early systems were centralized, relying on a single repository server, while later systems introduced
distributed collaboration
</p>

<l1>1972: Source Code Control System (SCCS) – one of the first version control systems, developed
at Bell Labs, which introduced the basic idea of tracking changes (initially used on IBM
mainframes).</l1>
<l2>
1982: Revision Control System (RCS) – released by Walter Tichy at Purdue University, RCS
automated change tracking for individual files using delta storage (storing differences between
file versions) . RCS was a local VCS (no network support), handling one file at a time.
</l2>
<l3>
1986: Concurrent Versions System (CVS) – developed by Dick Grune as a front-end to RCS, CVS
allowed collaboration on whole projects with a client-server model . It added networked
repositories and concurrent multi-developer capabilities to RCS. CVS became widely used in the
1990s for open-source and commercial projects, despite limitations (e.g. non-atomic commits
and tricky branching).
</l3>
<l3>
2000: Subversion (SVN) – created by CollabNet as a successor to CVS, Subversion improved on
CVS’s weaknesses. SVN introduced atomic commits (all-or-nothing changesets), better handling
of file renames, and more efficient network operations. By ~2006, SVN had become one of the
most popular VCS tools, addressing many of CVS’s shortcomings . SVN was still
centralized: a single repository stored the code, and developers committed to that central server.
</l3>
<l4>
2005: Git and Mercurial – a breakthrough year for version control. In 2005, after the Linux
kernel’s commercial VCS (BitKeeper) license was revoked, Linus Torvalds created Git as a new
distributed VCS for the kernel . Around the same time, Matt Mackall released Mercurial. Both
Git and Mercurial are distributed version control systems (DVCS), meaning every user has a
full copy of the repository. Git quickly became the dominant VCS of the two – by 2019 it was
estimated to have ~80% market share vs. ~2% for Mercurial . (We’ll discuss distributed vs.
centralized concepts more in a moment.)
</l4>
<l5>
2008: GitHub launched – GitHub provided a web-based collaboration platform on top of Git. It
made sharing code and participating in projects easier with features like pull requests, issue
tracking, and social networking for developers. GitHub (and later similar services like Bitbucket
and GitLab) greatly accelerated Git’s adoption across the industry.

Late 2010s: GitOps and modern practices – In 2017, the term GitOps was introduced by
Weaveworks, highlighting an approach to use Git repositories as the single source of truth for
infrastructure and deployments (more on this later) . Integration of VCS with Continuous
Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines became mainstream, and cloud-hosted VCS
platforms grew in popularity.
</l7>
<l8>
2020s: AI and large-scale collaboration – Recent years have seen cloud platforms for VCS reach
massive scale (e.g. as of 2023 GitHub reported over 100 million developers using its platform
). Artificial intelligence is also beginning to assist in code management and review (with tools
like GitHub Copilot and AI-driven code review assistants). Version control remains central to
modern DevOps workflows, enabling everything from open-source projects with thousands of
contributors to automated infrastructure management via GitOps.

<h>Centralized vs. Distributed Version Control</h>
<p>
Centralized Version Control (CVCS): A single central repository on a server holds the “official”
copy of the code. Developers commit changes to this server and update (pull) changes from it.
Tools like RCS, CVS, and Subversion are centralized. In a CVCS, collaboration requires network
access to the server – if the server is down, nobody can commit changes. This model provides a
single source of truth and is straightforward to understand: everyone works on the same central
codebase . However, it creates a single point of failure (if the central repo is lost or
offline, work halts) . Collaboration is linear; merging changes from multiple developers can
be challenging, so teams often avoided creating too many branches in the past.

</p>
<p>
Distributed Version Control (DVCS): In distributed systems like Git or Mercurial, every developer
has their own full copy of the repository, including the entire history . There is no inherent
single master server – every clone can serve as a remote for others. Developers can commit
changes locally to their own repository (even offline), and later push those changes to share with
others or pull updates from peers. This offers greater flexibility: work can continue even if no
central server is accessible, and there’s redundancy (every clone is a backup of the project).
Merging is a first-class operation in DVCS, enabling prolific branching and non-linear
development workflows. Teams can still designate a “central” repository by convention (for
example, a main project repo on GitHub) – but the tools don’t enforce a single point of authority,
it’s a social/project choice.

</p>
<p>
In summary: Centralized systems are simple and good for a single source of truth, but suffer from
single-point failures and require connectivity for most operations. Distributed systems add complexity
in exchange for greater flexibility, offline work, and resilience – these have become dominant in modern
development.
